# FIRST RAILS PROJECT (A BLOG SITE)
This is my first attempt in creating an app using RAILS.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
The following were used to create this app:
-Ruby 2.4
-Rails 5.1.2
-Knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

### Installing

The first thing to do is to make sure that you have installed Ruby and Rails in your system.  
After this, you can open the terminal and locate the folder were the file is located then run the rails server.

Once server is running, you can open the app using Google Chrome.

## The Blog Site App

Running the App

Try cloning this repository using the following command in your Terminal:
$git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/marc-acm/First-Rails

Using your Terminal locate the path of the downloaded app or locate your file then open GitBash:
$cd blog

Once you are in the folder run the server:
$ bin/rails server

After running the server, open a web browser (Google Chrome) and you can start navigating to http://locahost:3000.  Below is the screenshot of the welcome page:
